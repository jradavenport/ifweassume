I'm a research professor at the University of Washington’s Department of Astronomy, and Associate Director of the DiRAC Institute. My research program focuses on studying time domain survey astronomy, with an emphasis on magnetically active stars from surveys like Kepler, ZTF, and TESS. I have also worked on many other topics such as gender equality in science, visualization and data science, and studying tweets. Sometimes I just make ridiculous things too. For a more complete picture of my astronomical research, check out my [academic website](http://jradavenport.github.io/) or my [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9wan6osj4g4knqm/davenport.cv.pdf?dl=1). For code I've worked on for various projects including many past dataviz projects, check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/jradavenport) page. [Here](http://jradavenport.github.io/media/) is a list of media coverage I've received for my work I try to keep up to date.

I love family, coffee, gardening, & the PNW.

This blog is my outlet to explore fun new data (i.e. not necessarily astronomy related), visualizations, vlogs, and to ask ridiculous questions. I welcome suggestions, feedback, or advice in the comments below each post. I also am interested in forming new and interesting collaborations with people!

I try to give citations/references where available. If you feel I have misrepresented your work/data, please drop me a line and I will rectify it immediately! I collect a small amount of user traffic data, using Google Analytics & Statcounter, but only for my own information.
