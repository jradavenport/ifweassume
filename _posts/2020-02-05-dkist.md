It is a GREAT time to be studying our nearest star, the Sun! NASA's [Solar Dynamics Observatory](https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/mission/) (SDO) is almost 10 years old, the [Parker Solar Probe](http://parkersolarprobe.jhuapl.edu) is currently **inside Mercury's orbit** working to directly study the solar wind, and *now* the incredible [Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope](https://www.nso.edu/telescopes/dki-solar-telescope) (DKIST) has achieved its ["first light"](https://www.nso.edu/inouye-solar-telescope-first-light/).

The first data from DKIST is seriously amazing. It's about 10 minutes of images, put into one incredible video that shows enormous, Texas-sized boils of gas rolling and convecting. There's also tiny features, little magnetically-generated hot spots that dance around between the big convective granules... it's really quite mesmerizing!
