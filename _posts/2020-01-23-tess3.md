## How NOT to write a proposal

After 10 days in Hawaii, working hard at AAS (check out my [daily Vlogs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL63VvE_3ck&list=PLWutIaedlwKRT-QE9bFrD6y-sTr1vY6oa) from the meeting!), giving 3 talks, and taking some family vacation time, I returned home to a very snowy Seattle... and a looming proposal deadline.

Working on short timelines is how we *always* seem to do things these days, but this was a bit ridiculous: I found myself the morning of the due date with NO proposal,  and a deadline at 130pm (local time)... ACK!

So after quick consideration, and digging up the NSF proposal I had written a few months earlier, I wrote the entire (4 page) TESS Cycle 3 proposal in about 3 hours!

**Phew**

You can enjoy a piece of that "journey" in [my latest video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flh3lCNpg3c)... and please, dear reader, do not try this at home (or work) if you can ever possibly help it. My review: 0/10, do not recommend writing a proposal in one morning.
