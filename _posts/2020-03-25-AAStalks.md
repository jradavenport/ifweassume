Right now the astronomy world is basically on lock-down due to the coronavirus/COVID-19 pandemic. Most observatories are closed, universities have gone to a distance learning mode, and astronomers are spending nearly all our time on Zoom - or as in my case, taking care of my kids and occasionally on Zoom!

Since I recently posted the final video in my [AAS 235 series](https://www.ifweassume.com/blog/AAS235.html) on the 'ol Astro Vlog, and people clearly are in need of things to watch to pass the time during our international social isolation period, here are the videos from *all three* of the talks I gave at AAS 235 back in January!


## [Stellar Astrophysics from the First Year(s) of TESS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfOEtQa8Kg0)

My all-out favorite of the three, this was a 10-min talk aimed at all astronomers, highlighting the amazing potential for TESS to study (and maybe even revolutionize) our understanding of variable stars!

## [SETI in Spatio-Temporal Surveys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF0G53Ei1tg)

A new "Special Session" was organized this year, focused on SETI and technosignature research. I'm **very** excited to see this area of astronomy grow in the next decade, and was pleased that the session was so well attended! My talk was focused on the recent paper I posted about using big data optical surveys in astronomy to develop new methods for technosignature research!

and as a bonus, if you're keen on this kind of work I talked more with David Kipping from the Cool Worlds lab (and YouTube channel) about SETI during AAS as well! [Video Here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmb1TblqwV0)

## [Flares in Kepler and TESS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0gmuC0JHwo)

This final video was actually my *first* presentation at the conference. I held the video back for a while because the audio is terrible! But that's not (only) because I'm not a professional videographer, the audio was horrid even in person! It was early in the conference, and we had some A/V troubles... Now, this happens from time to time, and to be honest I'm always impressed with how *smoothly* the AAS conferences go. Talks very rarely aren't available on the presenter laptops, microphones are available, tech support is quick to respond to any issues... Being a professional scientist means sometimes you just have to give your the best you can with a hot mic!

This talk was about the paper (currently under referee review) we wrote on the opportunity to study long-term flare activity using the combination of Kepler and TESS. It's a unique area for variable star research that I'm hoping we can utilize more in creative ways!
